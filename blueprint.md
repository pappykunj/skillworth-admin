# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for creating a login screen for the React application, connecting it to a Node.js backend for authentication. The base URL for the backend is `https://skillsworth-be-11s8.onrender.com/`.

## Current State

The project has a basic login page, a home page, and a success page. It uses `axios` for API requests and `react-router-dom` for routing. The styling is basic.

## Plan

1.  **Organize API Requests:** Create a dedicated module (`src/api/admin.js`) for admin-related API calls using a configured `axios` instance.
2.  **Improve Login Page Design:** Enhance the visual appeal of the `LoginPage` component with modern styling, including a better layout, color scheme, and typography.
3.  **Refactor `LoginPage.jsx`:** Update the `LoginPage` component to use the new API module for making the login request.
4.  **Update routing:** Update the routing in `App.jsx` to redirect to the login page by default.
